      <p>
        Hi I am Soumen Shee. I hail from Contai, Purba Medinipur, West Bengal. I
        am currently a second year student of Computer Science and Engineering.
        I like to spend my free time exploring hobbies such as planting and
        caring for trees, and saving water. I have three members in my family. I
        dream of working as a software engineer at IBM.
